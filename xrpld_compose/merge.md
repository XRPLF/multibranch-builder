# Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

## Description
Use when resolving merge conflicts after merging `develop` into a feature branch. Covers the key files that commonly conflict, field number allocation, namespace conventions, and the correct resolution strategy for each file type.

## General Principles

### Namespace
- All code uses `namespace xrpl { }` (not `ripple`). If a conflict shows `namespace ripple`, take the `xrpl` version.
- Qualified references: `xrpl::sign(...)`, `xrpl::sha256_hasher`, etc. Never `ripple::`.

### Header Guards
- Always `#pragma once`. Never `#ifndef` include guards. If a conflict shows old-style guards, take the `#pragma once` version.

### Copyright Headers
- The `develop` branch has removed copyright/license comment blocks from source files. If a conflict is just about the copyright header, take `develop`'s version (no header).

### File Moves
- Many files have been moved from `src/xrpld/` to `src/libxrpl/` or from `src/xrpld/` headers to `include/xrpl/`. If git shows a file as "deleted in develop" but it exists at a new path, delete the old-path file (`git rm`) and keep the new-path version.
- Common moves:
  - `src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/*.h` → `include/xrpl/tx/transactors/*.h`
  - `src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/*.cpp` → `src/libxrpl/tx/*.cpp` or `src/libxrpl/tx/transactors/*.cpp`
  - `src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/InvariantCheck.cpp` → `src/libxrpl/tx/invariants/InvariantCheck.cpp`

### Transactor Migration
When merging transactors from `src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/` into `develop`, they must be fully migrated to the new libxrpl structure:

**File locations:**
- Header: `src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Foo.h` → `include/xrpl/tx/transactors/Foo.h`
- Source: `src/xrpld/app/tx/detail/Foo.cpp` → `src/libxrpl/tx/transactors/Foo.cpp`
- Delete the old `.cpp` (both `src/xrpld/` and `src/libxrpl/` are GLOB_RECURSE discovered — duplicates cause linker errors)
- Optionally leave a forwarding header at the old `.h` location: `#include <xrpl/tx/transactors/Foo.h>`

**Header changes:**
- `#pragma once` (not `#ifndef` guards)
- `namespace xrpl` (not `ripple`)
- `#include <xrpl/tx/Transactor.h>` (not `<xrpld/app/tx/detail/Transactor.h>`)

**Source changes:**
- `namespace xrpl` (not `ripple`)
- `#include <xrpl/tx/transactors/Foo.h>` (not `<xrpld/app/tx/detail/Foo.h>`)
- `#include <xrpl/ledger/ApplyView.h>` (not `<xrpld/ledger/ApplyView.h>`)
- `#include <xrpl/ledger/View.h>` for `describeOwnerDir`

**API changes in the new Transactor:**
- `preflight1()` and `preflight2()` are **private** — transactor `preflight()` must NOT call them. The framework calls them automatically.
- Flag checking (`tfUniversalMask`) is handled by the framework via `getFlagsMask()`. Override `getFlagsMask()` only if custom flag handling is needed; otherwise the default handles `tfUniversalMask`.
- A simple `preflight()` that only did flag checks + preflight1/preflight2 should just `return tesSUCCESS;`
- `ctx_.app.journal(...)` → `ctx_.registry.journal(...)`
- `ctx_.app` does not exist in the new `ApplyContext`; use `ctx_.registry` for service access

**transactions.macro entry:**
Every transactor must have a `#if TRANSACTION_INCLUDE` block:
```cpp
#if TRANSACTION_INCLUDE
#   include <xrpl/tx/transactors/Foo.h>
#endif
TRANSACTION(ttFOO, <number>, Foo, ...)
```

### Include Paths
- `develop` uses the new macro-based transactor include system via `transactions.macro` with `TRANSACTION_INCLUDE`. Old-style explicit `#include <xrpld/app/tx/detail/*.h>` lists should be replaced with the macro approach.

## The core cost: registry-number collisions (READ THIS FIRST)

Most of the real conflict work in this repo is **not** logic — it's that six "registry"
files assign a unique number/char to each protocol entity, and every feature branch
greedily grabs "next available." When two branches (or a branch and develop) both grab
the same slot, they collide, and no choice of merge base removes it. These six files are
where 80% of the effort goes:

| File | Allocates | Collision key |
|---|---|---|
| `detail/sfields.macro` | serialized fields | (type, number) e.g. `(UINT32, 69)` |
| `detail/transactions.macro` | transaction types | tx type number |
| `detail/ledger_entries.macro` | ledger object types | hex ledger type `0x00XX` |
| `detail/features.macro` | amendments | name (+ ordering) |
| `protocol/TER.h` + `TER.cpp` | result codes | explicit tec numbers (tem/tef/ter are positional) |
| `protocol/Indexes.cpp` | `LedgerNameSpace` | single char |

**Universal resolution rule for all six:**
1. **develop's assignments are authoritative** — never renumber, reorder, or delete a develop entry.
2. **Keep the branch's NEW entries, but RENUMBER them** to the next free slot for that type/space.
   Find the next free slot before assigning (commands in each file's section below).
3. **Never reuse a deprecated/reserved slot** (chars in Indexes.cpp marked `[[deprecated]]`, retired
   amendments, "// NN deprecated" tx numbers). If a branch entry's NAME collides with a develop
   `[[deprecated]]` entry (common for `Contract`, etc.), rename the *deprecated* one (e.g.
   `Contract` → `ContractDeprecated`) to free the name while preserving the slot reservation.
4. **When integrating MULTIPLE feature branches together (alphanet):** check for collisions across
   ALL the branches being bundled, not just branch-vs-develop. Two features both grabbing tx 92 or
   tec 199 collide even though each is fine against develop alone.

**After renumbering, the entity's wire encoding changes** — but every reference is symbolic
(`ttFOO`, `sfBar`, `ltBaz`), so only the macro line changes; downstream code needs no edits.
This is safe for unreleased/alphanet features (no mainnet objects exist at the old number).

**Completeness check (this class of bug is silent):** when you take develop's version of a macro
and layer the branch's additions, it's easy to DROP a field the branch added to a develop entry
(e.g. the branch added `sfFinishFunction` to develop's `ltESCROW`, and taking develop's `ltESCROW`
verbatim loses it). After resolving, diff each entry's field set: for every `LEDGER_ENTRY` /
`TRANSACTION` the branch touched, confirm every `sf*` the branch had is still present in the
merged entry. A dropped field passes the build but throws `Template field error` at runtime.

## File-Specific Resolution Rules

### `include/xrpl/protocol/detail/features.macro`

**`develop`'s amendment list is authoritative. Never regenerate, reorder, or overwrite it — only ADD the branch's genuinely new amendment(s).**

Take `develop`'s (the incoming base's) entire amendment list verbatim: every `XRPL_FEATURE` / `XRPL_FIX` / `XRPL_RETIRE_*` line, in develop's order, with develop's exact `Supported::` and `VoteBehavior::` flags. Do **not** change a develop amendment's flags, do **not** reorder develop's entries, and do **not** delete any of them.

New feature amendments go **at the top** of the active list (below the macro guard checks and `// clang-format off`), in reverse chronological order.

```
// Add new amendments to the top of this list.
// Keep it sorted in reverse chronological order.

XRPL_FEATURE(MyNewFeature,              Supported::Yes, VoteBehavior::DefaultNo)
XRPL_FIX    (ExistingFix,               Supported::Yes, VoteBehavior::DefaultNo)
...
```

Resolution — decide per amendment on the feature branch's side of the conflict:
- **Already on develop** → keep develop's line unchanged; ignore the branch's copy (do not duplicate, do not re-flag).
- **New on the branch, absent from develop** → add it at the very top. For an alphanet integration build these branch amendments are set `Supported::Yes` so the genesis network can vote them.
- **On the branch but REMOVED from develop** (upstream retired/renamed/consolidated it — e.g. `Batch` / `BatchInnerSigs` → `BatchV1_1`) → **drop it. Do not re-add it, and never create a `Supported::No` "compile-compat" stub for it.** A missing amendment is not a merge conflict to paper over — the branch code that still references the old name must be ported to develop's replacement (a code fix, not a macro entry). Adding a stub silently ships a dead amendment and hides un-ported branch code.

### `include/xrpl/protocol/detail/sfields.macro`

Fields are grouped by type (UINT32, UINT64, UINT128, etc.) with common and uncommon sections. Each field has a unique **type + field number** pair.

**Resolution strategy:**
1. Keep both sides' new fields.
2. Check for field number collisions within each type. Use the next available number for your feature's fields.
3. Common fields come first, uncommon fields after (there's a comment separator).

To find the next available field number for a type:
```bash
grep "TYPED_SFIELD.*UINT32" include/xrpl/protocol/detail/sfields.macro | sed 's/.*UINT32, *//;s/).*//' | sort -n
```

Similarly for OBJECT and ARRAY types (using `UNTYPED_SFIELD`):
```bash
grep "UNTYPED_SFIELD.*OBJECT" include/xrpl/protocol/detail/sfields.macro | sed 's/.*OBJECT, *//;s/).*//' | sort -n
grep "UNTYPED_SFIELD.*ARRAY" include/xrpl/protocol/detail/sfields.macro | sed 's/.*ARRAY, *//;s/).*//' | sort -n
```

### `include/xrpl/protocol/detail/transactions.macro`

Transaction types have a unique **transaction type number**. New feature transactions go **at the bottom** of the active transaction list (before the system transactions starting at 100+).

**Resolution strategy:**
1. Keep all of `develop`'s transactions.
2. Add your feature's transactions at the bottom with the next available number.
3. Use the new 7-argument `TRANSACTION` macro format:

```cpp
/** Description of the transaction */
#if TRANSACTION_INCLUDE
#   include <xrpl/tx/transactors/MyTransactor.h>
#endif
TRANSACTION(ttMY_TX, <next_number>, MyTx,
    Delegation::delegable,
    featureMyFeature,
    noPriv, ({
    {sfSomeField, soeREQUIRED},
}))
```

To find the next available transaction number:
```bash
grep "^TRANSACTION(" include/xrpl/protocol/detail/transactions.macro | sed 's/.*,\s*\([0-9]*\),.*/\1/' | sort -n
```

Note: Transaction numbers 100+ are reserved for system transactions (amendments, fees, UNL).

### `include/xrpl/protocol/detail/ledger_entries.macro`

Ledger entry types have a unique **ledger type number** (hex). New entries go **at the bottom** of the active list.

**Resolution strategy:**
1. Keep all of `develop`'s entries.
2. Add your feature's entries at the bottom with the next available hex number.
3. Check for collisions:

```bash
grep "^LEDGER_ENTRY(" include/xrpl/protocol/detail/ledger_entries.macro | grep -o '0x[0-9a-fA-F]*'  | sort
```

### `src/libxrpl/protocol/Indexes.cpp`

The `LedgerNameSpace` enum assigns a unique single character to each ledger entry type for index hashing.

**Resolution strategy:**
1. Keep both sides' entries.
2. Check for character collisions. Each entry needs a unique char.
3. Find used characters:

```bash
grep -E "^\s+[A-Z_]+ = " src/libxrpl/protocol/Indexes.cpp | sed "s/.*= '//;s/'.*//" | sort | tr -d '\n'
```

Also check the deprecated chars (reserved, cannot reuse):
```bash
grep "deprecated" src/libxrpl/protocol/Indexes.cpp | sed "s/.*= '//;s/'.*//"
```

### `src/libxrpl/protocol/InnerObjectFormats.cpp`

Inner object formats define the fields allowed inside array elements (e.g., `sfSigners`, `sfPasskeys`).

**Resolution:** Keep both sides' `add(...)` calls. No numbering conflicts here — just ensure no duplicate registrations.

### `src/libxrpl/protocol/STTx.cpp`

The `singleSignHelper` function was refactored in `develop`:
- Parameter name: `sigObject` (not `signer`)
- Signature retrieval: `sigObject.getFieldVL(sfTxnSignature)` (not `getSignature(signer)`)
- No `fullyCanonical` parameter — canonical sig checking was simplified

**Resolution:** Take `develop`'s function signatures and patterns. Adapt any feature-specific logic to match.

### `src/libxrpl/protocol/SecretKey.cpp`

**Resolution:** Use `namespace xrpl`. Keep any additional `#include` directives your feature needs (e.g., OpenSSL headers for new key types).

### `src/libxrpl/tx/Transactor.cpp`

The `checkSign` / `checkSingleSign` / `checkMultiSign` functions were refactored in `develop`:
- `checkSingleSign` no longer takes a `Rules` parameter
- `checkSign` has a new overload taking `PreclaimContext`
- `checkBatchSign` uses the simplified `checkSingleSign` call

**Resolution:** Take `develop`'s function signatures. Add any new authentication checks (e.g., passkey verification) into `checkSingleSign` before the final `return tefBAD_AUTH`, using `view.read(...)` to check ledger state.

### `src/libxrpl/tx/applySteps.cpp`

**Resolution:** Always take `develop`'s macro-based include approach:
```cpp
#include <xrpl/tx/applySteps.h>
#pragma push_macro("TRANSACTION")
#undef TRANSACTION

#define TRANSACTION(...)
#define TRANSACTION_INCLUDE 1

#include <xrpl/protocol/detail/transactions.macro>

#undef TRANSACTION
#pragma pop_macro("TRANSACTION")
```

Never use the old explicit `#include <xrpld/app/tx/detail/*.h>` list.

### `src/test/jtx/impl/utility.cpp`

The `sign` function was refactored in `develop`:
- Takes `sigObject` parameter: `sign(Json::Value& jv, Account const& account, Json::Value& sigObject)`
- Has an overload: `sign(Json::Value& jv, Account const& account)` that calls `sign(jv, account, jv)`
- Uses `xrpl::sign(...)` not `ripple::sign(...)`

**Resolution:** Take `develop`'s function signatures. Adapt feature-specific signing logic to the new pattern.

## Conflict Resolution Checklist

1. List all conflicted files: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Check which have actual conflict markers vs just unmerged: `grep -l "<<<<<<< HEAD" <file>`
3. For files without markers: stage them or `git rm` if they were moved
4. For each file with markers:
   - Take `develop`'s structural changes (namespace, function signatures, macro formats)
   - Preserve your feature's additions (new fields, entries, transactions, logic)
   - Resolve any numbering collisions by incrementing to the next available number
5. Stage resolved files: `git add <file>`
6. Verify no remaining markers: `grep -r "<<<<<<< " --include="*.cpp" --include="*.h" --include="*.macro"`
7. Verify no remaining unmerged: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
